    <h2>Edge4Future - Call for Papers</h2>

    <p>Edge Computing, an umbrella term including in our workshop context MultiAccess Edge Computing (MEC), Fog Computing and Cloudlet Computing, now seems essential for future communication architectures. It will enable the development of new applications with significant constraints in terms of latency, computing capacity, bandwidth and energy. These include intelligent transportation, autonomous fleets (terrestrial, maritime or flying), smart energy management and pervasive environment for people or advanced BroadBand Mobile services (Augmented/Virtual/Mixed Reality).</p>
    <p>In a context of highly evolving telecoms networks, due to the multiplication of radio access technologies (terrestrial - cellular, LPWAN, WiFi, etc. - and non-terrestrial - satellite) and the increasing computing capacity of terminals, the deployment potential of this technology is very high today.</p>
    <p>As a consequence, a complex ecosystem of interconnected applications, services, and physical/virtual devices, with a high degree of heterogeneity, emerges. This heterogeneity must be addressed by novel solutions able to understand the specificity of these environments, closest as possible to the users while displaying flexibility to the adaptation required by the dynamic character of the edge of the network.</p>
    <p><b>Topics of Interest</b> The First International Workshop on Edge Systems for Future Mobile Networks (<b>Edge4Future</b>) focuses on the Mobile Edge paradigm and target the various research domains spanning from the end-device to the edge servers, through the gateways linking them both. Central topics of interest include the design, implementation, and operation of these components and how they process data and communicate with each other. Specific topics of interest include, but are not limited to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Resource management at the edge (Communication, Storage, Computing, Energy, etc.);</li>
        <li>Service placement on constrained end-devices (low-link budgets, reduce bandwidth or high churn environments);</li>
        <li>Tasks offloading and scheduling at the edge;</li>
        <li>Modeling, monitoring and analysis of heterogeneous edge networks;</li>
        <li>New architectures for Edge Computing deployment;</li>
        <li>Real-world experimentation of innovative Edge Computing Architectures;</li>
        <li>Real-world experimentation of Edge Computing Use Cases (Mobile BroadBand Services, URLLC services, etc.);</li>
        <li>Innovative security solutions for Edge Computing environments;</li>
        <li>Federated/Distributed approaches for multiple edge networks collaborations;</li>
        <li>Cognitive and Context-Aware services for various edge applications;</li>
        <li>Application of Artificial-Intelligence (AI) tools for decision process automation at the edge;</li>
        <li>Game-theoretic and multi-agent approaches to distributed algorithms at the edge.</li>
    </ul>
