    <h2>Edge4Future - Call for Papers</h2>

    <p>Edge Computing, an umbrella term including in our workshop context MultiAccess Edge Computing (MEC), Fog Computing and Cloudlet Computing, now seems essential for future communication architectures. It will enable the development of new applications with significant constraints in terms of latency, computing capacity, bandwidth and energy. These include intelligent transportation, autonomous fleets (terrestrial, maritime or flying), smart energy management and pervasive environment for people or advanced BroadBand Mobile services (Augmented/Virtual/Mixed Reality).</p>
    <p>In a context of highly evolving telecoms networks, due to the multiplication of radio access technologies (terrestrial - cellular, LPWAN, WiFi, etc. - and non-terrestrial - satellite) and the increasing computing capacity of terminals, the deployment potential of this technology is very high today.</p>
